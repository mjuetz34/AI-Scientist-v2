    "Short Hypothesis": "Deep learning models can significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of CD44 expression quantification in immunohistochemical images compared to traditional semiquantitative assessment, leading to more reliable prognostic predictions in HNSCC patients receiving postoperative radiochemotherapy.",
    "Related Work": "While previous studies have established CD44 as a potential tumor stem cell marker in HNSCC with prognostic relevance, current assessment methods rely on subjective semiquantitative evaluation by pathologists. Recent advances in computer vision and medical image analysis have shown promise in improving biomarker quantification accuracy. Our approach builds upon existing immunohistochemical assessment protocols while introducing AI-driven quantification methods to reduce inter-observer variability and enhance clinical utility.",
    "Abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients show heterogeneous clinical outcomes despite similar staging, highlighting the need for robust prognostic biomarkers. CD44, a tumor stem cell marker, has shown promise but suffers from subjective assessment methods. This study proposes an AI-enhanced approach for CD44 quantification using deep learning models trained on immunohistochemical tissue microarray data. We will develop convolutional neural networks capable of automated CD44 expression scoring, validate against expert pathologist assessments, and evaluate prognostic performance. The approach integrates tissue microarray image analysis with clinical outcome data from a multicenter cohort of 195 HNSCC patients receiving postoperative radiochemotherapy. By improving quantification accuracy and reducing assessment variability, this AI-enhanced method could enable more precise patient stratification and personalized treatment decisions.",
